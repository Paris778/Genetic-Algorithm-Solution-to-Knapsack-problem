A Genetic Algorithm Solution to the Knapsack Problem in MatLab using the elitist selection process

## The Knapsack Problem

The problem is that we are given an X amount of items, each occupying some specific units of space and
worth some amount of money. We have to figure out which of these items to take (or not take), in
order to keep the total units of space to within a specified maximum, while trying to maximise the
total amount of money your items are worth.
The units of space and the amount for each of the 16 items are:

For example, if you were to take the 1st, 2nd and 4th items, the total units of space would be 14, and
the total value would be Â£10.6. You have to take a set of items so that the total units of space is 40
or below, and the total value is as high as it can be.
